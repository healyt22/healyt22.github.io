        <p class="lead text-left">I created this website to organize the skills that I've been building over the years. I'd like to do so by illustrating my experiences, showcasing some cool projects I've built, and provide information on how to contact me.</p>
        <p class="lead text-left">For work, I analyze and optimize supply on Oath's display, video, and mobile advertising platforms. I'm also pursuing a MS in Applied and Computation Mathematics part-time at Johns Hopkins Unversity.</p>
