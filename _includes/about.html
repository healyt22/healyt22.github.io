        <p class="lead text-left">I created this website to illustrate the skills I have been building over the years. I'll paint the picture by organizing my experiences, showcasing cool projects, and consolidating my internet prescence. The website itself is built with the bootstrap framework sitting on top of a github repository.</p>
        <p class="lead text-left">My career began in finance, with aspirations of eventually getting an MBA. After assessing and quantifying risk at an energy commodities trading firm, and building a forecasting model to raise capital for a solar and wind power company, my career started to evolve. I had always enjoyed building models but I was ready to take another step forward into data science.</p>
        <p class="lead text-left">To achieve this, I realized that I needed to work with more data, and learn about more advanced analysis. So I now work as a Platforms Optimization Lead at Oath, analyzing and optimizing supply on its legacy AOL and Yahoo! advertising platforms. Additionally, I am pursuing a MS in Applied and Computational Mathematics at Johns Hopkins Unversity. </p>
        <p class="lead text-left">Enjoy the site!</p>
